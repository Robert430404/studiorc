# Studio RC - My Portfolio

This is my current portfolio. This project will be used to show case my understanding of the laravel framework in addition to my design and development skills. Please feel free to look through the source and give me feedback on the state of the project!

As of Tuesday April 12th, the project was pushed into production and can be viewed at: http://www.studiorclv.com/.

All in all this was a very simple project, but it also allowed me to showcase a fairly complete understanding of the laravel framework. This project allowed me to use the Mail, Storage, and Eloquent Model Facades to showcase my ability within laravel. I was also able to create a console command that used Eloquent which showcased my understanding of Artisan and console interactions.
